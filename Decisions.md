## Decision 001 — End-of-Day Only (No Intraday)
Date: 2026-02-19
Decision: Process only EOD (end-of-day) data, not intraday.
Reason: Lower complexity, lower cost, cleaner signals, lower compliance friction.
Status: FINAL — do not revisit in prototype phase.

## Decision 002 — No ML in V1
Date: 2026-02-19
Decision: No machine learning models in prototype or V1 SaaS.
Reason: Must be deterministic, explainable, and backtestable. Avoid black-box risk.
Status: FINAL.

## Decision 003 — Single Container (No Microservices)
Date: 2026-02-19
Decision: Single Dockerized Python service for all quant engines.
Reason: Reduce complexity in prototype phase. Microservices only after SaaS launch.
Status: FINAL for prototype.

## Decision 004 — AWS Region ap-south-1
Date: 2026-02-19
Decision: All AWS resources in Mumbai (ap-south-1).
Reason: Lowest latency for NSE data ingestion; aligns with existing infra.
Status: FINAL.

## Decision 005 — PostgreSQL on RDS (Not Local)
Date: 2026-02-19
Decision: Use AWS RDS PostgreSQL even in prototype phase.
Reason: Makes it a proper DevOps portfolio project, not just a local script.
Status: FINAL.

## Decision 006 — Terraform Module Reuse
Date: 2026-02-19
Decision: Reuse vpc, rds, ecs, iam module structure from Sovereign Retirement project.
Reason: Proven pattern, faster execution, consistent naming.
Status: FINAL.

## Decision 007 — Prototype Score Model: 0–5 (Not 0–100)
Date: 2026-02-19
Decision: Use simplified 0–5 binary scoring for the prototype.
Reason: Faster to build and validate. Upgrade to weighted 0–100 in SaaS phase.
Status: FINAL for prototype only.

## Decision 008 — No UI in Prototype
Date: 2026-02-19
Decision: No frontend, no dashboard, no API in prototype phase.
Reason: Output is CSV + PDF performance report only. SaaS UI comes after viability is proven.
Status: FINAL.
