# **MRI Sessions Log**

## **April 13, 2026: Pipeline Scheduler Restore**
- **Issue**: Frontend data stopped updating after Apr 7 because the GitHub Actions pipeline had no schedule (manual dispatch only).
- **Fix**: Added a weekday cron trigger (10:30 UTC / 4:00 PM IST) to `.github/workflows/FINAL_FIX.yml` so the ingestion pipeline runs automatically.
- **Next Step**: Verify the next scheduled run completes and the dashboard reflects fresh data; rerun manually via workflow_dispatch if needed.

## **April 6, 2026: The "Madness of the Ghost Relation"**
- **Objective**: Resolve persistent `index_prices` schema crash on GitHub Actions.
- **Root Cause**: Naming collision and shadowing.
  1.  **Import Shadowing**: Root `db.py` was being loaded by the GitHub Runner instead of `src/db.py`, causing my fixes to be ignored.
  2.  **Relation Collision**: The name `index_prices` was likely clashing with a system object or a stale view in the Neon DB, causing `ALTER TABLE` commands to fail for that specific name despite being technically correct.
- **Resolution**:
  - **The Migration**: Renamed the relation throughout the stack to **`market_index_prices`**. This guaranteed a fresh database entry with no stale metadata.
  - **The Tracer**: Implemented `DEBUG: LOADING ...` print statements in all DB modules to immediately detect it if GitHub Actions starts shadowing our files again.
  - **Final Step**: Synchronized all modules to use atomic, committed migrations.

## **April 6, 2026 (AM): Signal Verification & Ingestion Refactoring**
- **Objective**: Hardened the ingestion engine to handle NSE/BSE metadata changes.
- **Status**: ✅ **STABLE**.
- **Actions**:
  - Implemented `EQUITY_L.csv` and `List_of_companies.csv` fuzzy joining.
  - Added blacklist for delisted symbols.
  - Fixed NIFTY 50 OHLCV handling in `ingestion_engine.py`.

## **April 3, 2026: RLS and Security Hardening**
- **Objective**: Enforce client isolation and secure schema defaults.
- **Action**: Enabled Row Level Security on `client_watchlist` and forced schema-prefixed table references.
- **Result**: ✅ **SECURED**.
